# DoublePendulum

This a double pendulum simulation implemented using OpenGl 4.6 with C++

Implemented an accurate physics-based model of the double pendulum system.

Implemented rendering of 500 instances of the double pendulum within the simulation to demonstrate chaotic behavior and extreme sensitivity to initial conditions.
Utilized OpenGL matrix transformations to handle the rendering process.

Optimized the simulation for efficient performance and smooth rendering at 60 fps.

Simulation still framerate based rather than time based.

Compile with visual studio to get working

Different colors not implemented yet.
